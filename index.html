                <h2>Sypnosis of 'Doraemon'</h2>
                <p>Nobita Nobi is a ten-year-old Japanese school boy, who is kind-hearted and honest, but also lazy, unlucky, weak, gets
                bad grades and is bad at sports. One day, a blue robot cat from the 22nd century named Doraemon is sent back to the past
                by Nobita's future great-great-grandson, Sewashi Nobi, to take care of Nobita so that his descendants can have a better
                life. Doraemon has a four-dimensional pocket in which he stores tools, inventions, and gadgets from the future to aid
                Nobita whenever he is faced with a problem.
