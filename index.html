                <h2>About India</h2>
                <p>India is a land of vibrant colors, exotic flavors, and deep-rooted traditions. It is a diverse multiethnic country with
                thousands of small ethnic and tribal groups. India's cultural diversity is reflected in its religious practices,
                festivals, art forms, music, and culinary traditions. This diversity has evolved over millennia due to historical
                influences, invasions, migrations, and colonialism. With more than a billion inhabitants, India is the worldâ€™s
                second-most populous country and is home to various religious and cultural communities.
